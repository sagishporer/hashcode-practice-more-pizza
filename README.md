# Hash Code 2020 practice problem solution: More Pizza

Algorithm type: greedy + optimizations:
1. Sort pizzas, largest number of slices first.
2. Add pizzas while there's room.
3. Optimization phase 1: Scan solution, remove single pizza from solution each time, and try to add other pizzas so the score will improve.
4. Optimization phase 2: Scan solution, remove all combinations of 2 pizzas from solution, and try to add other pizzas so the score will improve.

Solution score:  1,505,004,616
* A: 16
* B: 100
* C: 4,500
* D: 1,000,000,000
* E: 505,000,000
